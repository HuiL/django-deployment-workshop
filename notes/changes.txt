Changes
=======

The deployment world changes quickly, and I'm trying to keep these 
examples up-to-date with recent changes. To that end, I'll explain
here all the changes I make as I update the tutorial.

July 2010 (OSCON)
-----------------

* Updated to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

  Whenever possible, I prefer to deploy against Ubuntu's LTS (long-term
  support) releases. However, when I originally wrote this tutorial (Feb
  2010) the previous LTS was exceedingly long in the tooth and missing most
  of the modern Python kit.
  
  Now that 10.04 is out along with all the modern Python goodness it'll
  probably remain my preferred server OS for a couple-three years.
  
* Dropped the database replication example.

  PostgreSQL 9.0 ships soon, and will radically change PostgreSQL's
  replication/clustering story. Also, in previous classes this was the
  least "interesting" part according to attendees. So, it's been dropped so
  that I can spend more time on the other parts. Instead, I'll cover
  replication as part of the "what's next" roundup at the end.
